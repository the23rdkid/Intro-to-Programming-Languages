/**********************************************************************
 *  Have you enter all help, collaboration, and outside resources
 *  in your help log?  If not, do so now.  (And in future, make sure
 *  you make your help log entries as you go, not at the end!)
 *
 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."
 **********************************************************************/

I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours. I did not collaborate 
    with anyone, and I did not use any resources beyond the standard course 
    materials. 


/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe your artistic creation, and how you went about writing   
 *  a program to produce it. If you used any sources such as the book
 *  or booksite, reference them here. 
 **********************************************************************/
My creation is a teenager Dexter who has now become smarter, slightly rebellious
    and loves Chemistry. He mixes chemicals to make Crystalline weapons 
    which he hopes to use to rule the world. I made one crystal which replicates
    itself, being half - sized with each recursive call; with the final product
    being a crystal lattice(the chemical weapon). 
 
 

/**********************************************************************
 *  Is the following a use of recursion? yes/no - Yes
 *  Recall the meaning of recusion as defined by cis110.
 *  
 * public static void a() {
 *     b(5);
 *     b(2);
 *     b(7);
 *     b(4); 
 * }
 * public static void b(int a) {
 *     a();
 * }
 *
 *  Explain your reasoning in 20 WORDS OR LESS.

The function calls on itself so it's recursive





/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.

        I found this assignment really interesting and fun. It took me a while
        to figure out how to do it but once I did it was very enjoyable.
