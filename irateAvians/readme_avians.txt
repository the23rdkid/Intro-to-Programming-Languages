/**********************************************************************
 *  Have you enter all help, collaboration, and outside resources
 *  in your help log?  If not, do so now.  (And in future, make sure
 *  you make your help log entries as you go, not at the end!)
 *
 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."
 **********************************************************************/

I've entered all help, collaboration and outside resources in my help log


/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/

I had lots of trouble visualising the end point of my line and drawing it
    It was really frustrating considering how easy this command is essentially
    supposed to be but I'm so glad it finally works! 


/**********************************************************************
 *  If you completed the extra credit or added any additional features,
 *  provide DETAILED and CLEAR instructions for how to use them and 
 *  what we should look for when grading your assignment.

I am so excited that I finally got my program to run and having to ruminate on
    it and work on it over and over again actually helped me understand it 
    better!
