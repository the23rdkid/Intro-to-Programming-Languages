 *  Have you enter all help, collaboration, and outside resources

 *  you make your help log entries as you go, not at the end!)

 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."

 I particularly appreciated that we were learning more about cryptography. 
I wish we also had a CAPS person in the engineering quad like Wharton does, 
    because this assignment really took a great mental toll on me :'(
